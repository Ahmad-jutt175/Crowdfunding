This Crowdfunding Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum 
blockchain using Solidity. It enables individuals or organizations to raise funds for 
projects through direct contributions from participants in the form of Ether (ETH). 
The contract includes mechanisms for participants to contribute funds during a specified 
funding period. Once the funding goal is met before the deadline, the project owner can 
claim the funds to finance their project. If the goal is not reached within the set 
timeframe, participants can reclaim their contributed funds. The contract promotes 
transparency and trust by automating the fund management process through immutable 
smart contracts, ensuring fair and secure fundraising.
